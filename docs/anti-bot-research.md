| Rebrowser               | [Patches](https://github.com/rebrowser/rebrowser-patches), [Node package](https://github.com/rebrowser/rebrowser-playwright); npm metadata reports Apache-2.0 | Selected default, pinned at 1.64.101. Preserves the Node/Playwright service and fixes CDP and storage-partitioning signals.                                                                           |
| Patchright              | [Driver](https://github.com/Kaliiiiiiiiii-Vinyzu/patchright), [Node package](https://github.com/Kaliiiiiiiiii-Vinyzu/patchright-nodejs); Apache-2.0           | Integrated alternative, pinned at 1.64.2. Clears the tested webdriver/CDP signals, but retains a detectable storage-partitioning configuration.                                                       |
| Camoufox                | [Repository](https://github.com/daijro/camoufox); browser MPL-2.0, Python/TypeScript launchers MIT, additional vendored notices                               | A Firefox alternative with native fingerprint work and TypeScript support. Requires another browser distribution and a separate compatibility benchmark. Reviewed, not installed or benchmarked here. |
| Puppeteer Extra stealth | [Repository](https://github.com/berstend/puppeteer-extra)                                                                                                     | An established alternative. Patched Playwright drivers preserve the existing service and address CDP directly. Not benchmarked here.                                                                  |

The registry was checked directly for pinned driver versions. Project claims
about being undetectable or passing commercial products are not adopted as
verified outcomes. No npm alias replaces the stock Playwright core. Rebrowser's
README documents an older core-alias collision; 1.64.101 depends on
`rebrowser-playwright-core` by its real package name.

## Implementation

- Select `BROWSER_ENGINE=rebrowser|patchright|playwright`.
- Keep the existing `/scrape` contract and Firecrawl adapter.
- Use full Chromium and native UA/platform/client hints; remove random UA
  generation and unnecessary GPU disabling. Preserve explicit caller headers.
- Keep isolated per-request contexts without a shared cookie jar or persistent
  customer profile.
- Use headful Chromium under Xvfb in Docker with `init: true`; expose local
  headless/headful and system-Chrome options.
- Preserve SSRF filtering, pinned DNS, and upstream proxy support. Route browser
  loopback traffic through the filtering proxy too.
- Report recognized interstitials through `pageError`, including HTTP 200
  challenge bodies. Retain target 403/429 statuses.
- Fix IP-address cookie seeding found by the redirect regression: Chromium
  rejects domain cookies such as `.127.0.0.1`.
- Log header names rather than credential-bearing values.

## Evidence

The pre-change service was run through HTTP against a controlled JavaScript
gate. It reported `navigator.webdriver=true`, failed to retrieve the protected
record, and randomly advertised iPhone/Safari on desktop Chromium. The baseline
receipt is retained outside build output at `_local/anti-bot/baseline.json`
(ignored by Git).

Real-browser HTTP tests cover the gate, page/worker identity consistency,
caller UA/headers/cookies through redirects, landed URLs, context isolation,
unresolved challenges, ordinary Turnstile forms, 403/429 responses, validation,
failed-selector cleanup, and default private-target rejection. Helper tests
also exercise pinned DNS and proxy denial with a DNS-rebinding negative control.

Public diagnostics were loaded through `/scrape` with native, headful Google
Chrome on macOS. Raw receipts are `_local/anti-bot/headful-live.json` (stock and
Patchright) and `_local/anti-bot/rebrowser-live.json` (Rebrowser).

| Observed signal                | Stock Playwright | Patchright | Rebrowser |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------- | ---------- | --------- |
| Controlled protected record    | Blocked          | Retrieved  | Retrieved |
| Sannysoft webdriver check      | Detected         | Passed     | Passed    |
| Rebrowser CDP runtime leak     | Detected         | Passed     | Passed    |
| Rebrowser storage partitioning | Detected         | Detected   | Passed    |

The [Rebrowser diagnostic](https://bot-detector.rebrowser.net/) has 20 rows in
these runs: 16 triggered checks and four untriggered checks. Rebrowser passed
the 16 triggered checks. Grey rows need APIs the scraper does not invoke
(`dummyFn`, source-URL/main-world probes and `exposeFunction`); they are excluded
from pass counts. This tests the passive scraper workflow. The
[diagnostic source](https://github.com/rebrowser/rebrowser-bot-detector) describes
the additional probes. [Sannysoft](https://bot.sannysoft.com/) is a separate live
diagnostic; neither result establishes production coverage.

Final focused checks passed: `pnpm build`, 12 helper tests (`pnpm test`),
33 real-browser HTTP tests (`pnpm test:integration`), and
`pnpm audit --prod` (no known vulnerabilities). `docker compose config`
confirmed the default Rebrowser/headful configuration and `init: true`.
The Linux ARM64 image was built and started with `--init`; `/health` reported
Rebrowser/headful, an HTTPS scrape retrieved Example Domain, and a private
target was denied. Its receipt is `_local/anti-bot/container-smoke.json`.
The full Firecrawl API/worker stack was not started in this verification.
The focused `Browser engine integration` workflow runs these build, helper,
HTTP-integration, and dependency-audit checks on standard GitHub Ubuntu runners.
The inherited full server/audit workflows use Blacksmith runners; their status
is separate from this focused workflow.

## Limits

No production target portfolio or paid proxy service was supplied. There is no
measured success rate against Cloudflare, DataDome, Akamai, or other commercial
WAF deployments. CAPTCHA solving, authentication acquisition, proxy rotation,
and IP-reputation remediation are not implemented by these drivers. A remaining
challenge is reported, not relabeled as a successful scrape.

Browser versions, diagnostics and WAF rules change. Re-run the bounded benchmark
after driver/browser changes and evaluate the actual target portfolio before
promising coverage. Preserve receipts from unsuccessful runs too.
